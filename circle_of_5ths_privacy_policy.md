# Circle of 5ths Privacy Policy

I’m Anton Zhvakin the only developer of the Circle of 5ths. I believe privacy is a fundamental human right. That’s why my app Circle of 5ths doesn’t store or collect any of your personal data.

But I must mention that the Circle of 5ths uses Google Payments so please refer to its [Privacy Policy](https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/get_legal_document?ldo=0&ldt=privacynotice) and learn it.

If you have any questions about the document, please contact me via e-mail <anton.zhv@gmail.com>
